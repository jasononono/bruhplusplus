Example program written in b++:

def square w/ base arg;
   if arg is true,
     back (square (base ^ 2) false)
   back (base ^ 2)

loop i for (0 to 100);
   print (square i (i % 2))
   if not (i % 5),
      again
   elif i = 30,
      break

var thing = 'hello world!'
var thing2 = "\n{x}"
list thing3 = [thing, thing2]

print thing3 nl
